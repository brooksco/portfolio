        <p>As a computer scientist, I’m interested in the logic and process of computing. As a visual artist, I’m drawn to web development for its blend of graphic design, interactivity, and coding challenges. I graduated in 2013 from Grinnell College with a degree in Computer Science and a concentration in Neuroscience. I spent the next year working as a freelance developer and photographer in Seattle, Washington, and Wellington, New Zealand. More recently I worked as a Software Developer at a youth sports startup in Seattle, focused at times on front-end projects, back-end infrastructure, and mobile apps (native and hybrid).</p>

        <p>
          Currently I’m a student at Columbia University in New York, studying the integrations of arts and technology in education, and working part-time as a web developer for the program.

      </div>

      <div class="two-col">
        <p>The old RAYS site didn't have a lot of appeal. It had little in the way of personalized content that was at all relevant to the work they actually do. For an organization that does a large portion of its work from referrals, and relies on individual donors, this was less than ideal.</p>

        <p>Starting from scratch, I worked with RAYS staff to build a site filled with both more and more relevant descriptions of the work they do and the people they affect. Building better emotional connections with visitors to their site should allow them to foster more online donations, and become better known within the community. To this end I interviewed staff, collected stories of clients, wrote stories of clients, poured through grant applications, and took photos at events, of staff, and around their offices. This is alongside the technical aspects of making a site backed by a new content management system that's easier for staff to work with, so it can be updated more regularly by more people.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="two-col">
        <p>What do you do with a guest house? Rent it out. To this end, the owners of this particular guest house on Bainbridge Island wanted a website which would allow them to promote their property, and offer an convenient solution for online booking and payment. The site needed to be aesthetically and organizationally inline with the idea of a modern island cottage, while emphasizing its idyllic setting.</p>

        <p>Part of the project included photographing the interior and exterior of the guest house. Good imagery was identified as extremely important to attracting new guests, and so much of my time was spent carefully documenting the space and editing the resulting photos. Additionally, the site was setup with WordPress on the backend to enable the owners to easily add to these images over time (alongside being able to add other new content, like guest comments and updated activity lists).</p>

        <p>Portfolio sites can be an odd blend of needing to be familiar and easy to process, while at the same time standing out just enough to be remembered. Content really is key, and the design needs to reflect that. For Quinn Gundersen's portfolio I worked with him to find a clean style that reflected how he wanted to be seen, and was flexible enough to accomodate new and different types of work in the future.</p>

        <p>Built on WordPress so it's easy for him to update, and mobile friendly so it can be found and viewed anywhere, Fundersen.com is an important tool for Quinn to be able to best market his talents.</p>
