        <p>As a <strong>computer scientist</strong>, I’m interested in the process of problem solving. As an <strong>artist</strong>, I’m drawn to the web for its blend of design, interactivity, and freedom. As both, I'm passionate about utilizing technology to share and connect the arts with a global audience.</p>

        <p>I graduated in 2013 from Grinnell College with a BA in Computer Science and a concentration in <strong>Neuroscience</strong>. I spent a year working as a freelance creative in <strong>Seattle</strong> and <strong>New Zealand</strong>, before joining a youth sports tech startup as a software developer. There I worked front-end, back-end, and on mobile apps, native and hybrid.</p>

        <p>Since moving to NYC to study at Columbia University, I've interned with the <strong>Museum of Modern Art</strong>, working on a data analytics and ingestion project, and continued to freelance when time permits. I currently work in the Digital Media at the <strong>Whitney Museum</strong>.</p>

    <div class="two-col">
      <p>The old Renton Area Youth & Family Services (RAYS) website didn't have a lot of appeal, and lacked truly descriptive content about their services. For an organization that does a significant portion of its work from referrals and relies on individual donors, this was less than ideal.</p>

      <p>I worked with RAYS staff to build a website filled with more descriptions and more stories of the work they do, and the people they serve. Building better emotional connections with visitors to their website allows them to generate more donations, and become better known within the community. I interviewed staff, collected and wrote stories of clients, dug through grant applications, and took photos at events, of staff, and around their offices. Using the newly collected and generated content, I designed and built a new website backed by WordPress that's far easier for staff to work with, so it can be updated more regularly by more people.</p>

      <p>Hsuan came to me knowing she needed a new portfolio website. A web designer herself, she already had a design mockup but needed a developer to build a WordPress theme around it. Particularly important for the new website was that it would be fully responsive, and Hsuan left the details of the mobile implementation up to me with a few ideas to work from.</p>

      <p>The final website is very close but not exactly the same as the initial designs. As we communicated back and forth while I constructed the site, we discovered some changes we could make that would lead to a more functional (but equally asthetically pleasing) web experience.</p>

      <p>What do you do with a guest house? Rent it out. To this end, the owners of this particular guest house on Bainbridge Island wanted a website which would allow them to promote their property, and offer an convenient solution for online booking and payment. The site needed to be aesthetically and organizationally inline with the idea of a modern island cottage, while emphasizing its idyllic setting.</p>

      <p>Part of the project included photographing the interior and exterior of the guest house. Good imagery was identified as extremely important to attracting new guests, and I spent time carefully documenting the space and editing photos. The site is built on WordPress so it's easy for the owners to add new content as they see fit.</p>

      <p>Portfolio sites can be an odd blend of needing to be familiar and easy to process, while at the same time standing out just enough to be remembered.
