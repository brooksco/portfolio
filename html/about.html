      I've worked with youth, built websites for non-profits, developed software for a sports tech startup, run a bikeshare and a darkroom, and interned with the <strong>Whitney Museum</strong> and the <strong>Museum of Modern Art</strong> in Education and Digital Media. I graduated in 2013 from Grinnell College with a BA in <strong>Computer Science</strong>, a concentration in <strong>Neuroscience</strong>, and an affinity for the rural Midwest.

    <p>
      Currently I live in New York, completing my MA in Art and Art Education at Columbia University, and working at the Whitney Museum in Digital Media.

        I'm originally from Seattle, WA, and currently live in New York City. I am completing my MA in Art and Art Education at Columbia University, focusing on the intersection of arts and technology in education. I graduated in 2013 from Grinnell College in Iowa with a BA in <strong>Computer Science</strong>, a concentration in <strong>Neuroscience</strong>, and an affinity for the rural Midwest.

        My interests are pretty diverse, so I've ended up straddling a number of different disciplines over the years. I've spent time working with at-risk youth, doing art in the park with kids in Iowa, building websites for community non-profits, freelancing in New Zealand, and helping to teach teens traditional black and white photography. I've spent much of my time academically sticking to hard sciences, and particularly computer science. <strong>More recently</strong> I worked at a youth sports tech company as a full-stack developer, building team-managment and social web and mobile software. <strong>Most recently</strong> I've been working on digital projects with the Art & Art Education program at Columbia, interning with the Whitney Museum's teen program, and interning with the Digital Media department at the Museum of Modern Art. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I like a lot of different things, and particularly those that manage to bring together <strong>arts and science</strong> into a cohesive whole.
